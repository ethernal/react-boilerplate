I love good tools and love building them so here is another boilerplate based on the ideas from Kent C. Dodds. Mainly from videos about Jest runners and wanting to have all standard tools configured with Typescript.

This boilerplate tries to achive Typescript compatibility with React development while retaining standard JS tools like ESlint.

# Goal

Typescript used only for typechecking, React development with Jest as testing environment. All transpiled by Babel 7 and packaged with Webpack 4. ESLint for static code linting.

# What works

Typescript,
Jest,
Eslint,
React,
Babel,
Webpack,
Web Dev Server.

# WIP

-   webpack - it is limited in what it does at the moment, and bundle.js size is big. I will appreciate help with that.
-   HMR for React.
-   Styled Components.
-   SASS for Styled Components.
-   More Babel plugins like: register, polyfill etc.
-   suggestions?

PS. this is probably trivial for most experienced devs, but I have not found such project on the web so here it is. It took too long to make this work so I hope someone finds it useful.

I will be most grateful for suggestions as I am learning all the tools while building this.
