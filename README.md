I love good tools and love building them so here is another boilerplate based on the ideas from Kent C. Dodds. Mainly from:

This boilerplate tries to achive Typescript compatibility with React development while retaining standard JS tools like ESlint.

# Goal

Typescript only for typechecking, React development with Jest as testing environments all transpiled by Babel 7 and packaged with Webpack 4 while retaining ESLint capabilities for static code linting.

# What works

Typescript,
Jest
Eslint
React,
Babel,
Webpack,
Web Dev Server

# WIP

-   webpack - it is limited in what it does at the moment, and bundle.js size is big. I will appreciate help with that.
-   HMR for React.
-   Moar awesomeness.

PS. this is probably trivial for most experienced devs, but I just jumped the JS "hype" as the environment seemed mature enough. It took too long to make this work.
