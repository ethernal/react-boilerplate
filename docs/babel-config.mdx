Babel configuration is split into environments as described here: https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options#env

Babel configuration uses names for plugins and presets to allow more than 1 instance of the plugin to be loaded. This is due to DOCZ config being affected I think by `babel.config.js` or is a bug in DOCZ.
See last paragraph at: https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options#plugin-preset-merging

```javascript
plugins: [
  ["./plug", { one: true }, "first-instance-name"],
  ["./plug", { two: true }, "second-instance-name"],
];
```
